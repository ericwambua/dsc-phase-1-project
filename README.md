Now you will put your new skills to use with a large end-of-Phase project! This project should take 20 to 30 hours to complete.

## Project Overview

This project is purposed to carry out analysis and to give counsel to Microsoft Company in their venture into movie production, equipping the company with valuable insights and actionable recommendations to navigate the challenges and opportunities they will face in the business.

### Business Problem

Microsoft sees all the big companies creating original video content and they want to get in on the fun. They have decided to create a new movie studio, but they donâ€™t know anything about creating movies. You are charged with exploring what types of films are currently doing the best at the box office. You must then translate those findings into actionable insights that the head of Microsoft's new movie studio can use to help decide what type of films to create.

My analysis was be aimed towards answering the following qiestions;

1. Which genres of movies are mostly consumed
2. Movie genres with the highest Return on Investments
3. The correlation between production budget and the profits
4. Top movie studios that Microsoft will be competing against
5. Effect of Studio Popularity on Gross
6. relation between movie run time and its ratings

### The Data

In the the course of my analysis, I used  the following data:

* imdb.title.basics
* imdb.title.ratings
* bom.movie_gross
* tmdb.movies.csv

## Findings
1. Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi, and Fantasy genres have generated the highest total gross figures. However the Adventure, Drama, and Documentary genres were the top three based on their ratings as depicted by the below graphs.

2. The data suggested a slight positive relationship between average ratings and mean total gross and that there is minimal relationship between the runtime of a movie and its average ratings

3. The analysis indicated that there is a strong positive effect of a studio's popularity on its domestic gross.It as well suggests that the production budget has a relatively significant impact on  domestic and worldwide gross, as well as overall profits.
